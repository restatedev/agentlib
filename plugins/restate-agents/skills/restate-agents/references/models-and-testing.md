# Models and testing

## Model adapters

Every adapter journals each model call as one step with its own retry
policy. Constructing an adapter needs no credentials, so importing
services stays side-effect free.

Which adapter to use:

| Model                                                                            | Adapter                                                               |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OpenAI, Anthropic, Bedrock, Google, compatible servers, ... | `aiModel` from `@restatedev/agentlib/provider` with an AI SDK provider |
| A model served by another Restate handler                                        | `modelGateway` from `@restatedev/agentlib/provider`                   |
| A client of your own, or a test fixture                                          | `journaledModel` from `@restatedev/agentlib`                          |

### All providers: the AI SDK and `aiModel`

All providers come through the [Vercel AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev). The
SDK supplies the provider protocol only; Restate still owns the loop, tools,
retries, and journaling (`aiModel` sets the SDK's own retries to zero).

1. Install the provider package, for example `@ai-sdk/openai`, `@ai-sdk/anthropic`,
   `@ai-sdk/amazon-bedrock`, `@ai-sdk/google`, `@ai-sdk/mistral`, or
   `@openrouter/ai-sdk-provider`. The `ai` package itself ships with
   `@restatedev/agentlib`.
2. Create the provider's model object and wrap it with `aiModel`.

```ts
import {anthropic} from "@ai-sdk/anthropic";
import {aiModel} from "@restatedev/agentlib/provider";

export const model = aiModel({model: anthropic("claude-sonnet-5-5"), retry: {maxAttempts: 3}});
```

For OpenAI, install `@ai-sdk/openai` and use:

```ts
import {openai} from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import {aiModel} from "@restatedev/agentlib/provider";

export const model = aiModel({model: openai("gpt-5.6-luna"), retry: {maxAttempts: 3}});
```

The default OpenAI model uses Responses. For a Chat Completions-compatible
server, use `createOpenAI({baseURL, apiKey}).chat(modelId)` instead.

The provider reads its credentials (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, AWS credentials,
`GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`, ...) when the first call is made. Use the
provider's `create*` factory to pass a key, base URL, or custom fetch instead:

```ts
import {createAmazonBedrock} from "@ai-sdk/amazon-bedrock";

const bedrock = createAmazonBedrock({region: "us-east-1"});

export const model = aiModel({model: bedrock("<bedrock model id>")});
```

`aiModel` also accepts `providerOptions` (passed through to the provider), an
OpenTelemetry `tracer`, and `onChunk` for streaming text to a UI.


Prompt caching is on by default. `aiModel` marks the instructions (which
follow the tools), the newest message, and the message before the newest
model reply (where the previous request ended) as cache points for Anthropic
and Bedrock, so each step reads the previous step's prefix from the cache; other
providers cache prefixes on their own and ignore these options. Pass
`caching: false` to send none, for example for a Bedrock model without
prompt caching. `aiModel` reports `usage` when the provider gives counts:
`inputTokens` includes cached reads and writes, `cachedInputTokens` counts the
reads, and `cacheWriteInputTokens` the writes.

`aiModel` passes tool and `output` schemas to AI SDK as they are, so AI SDK's
defaults apply: tools are not strict, and OpenAI structured output is strict.
OpenAI strict mode requires every property, so use `.nullable()` rather than
`.optional()` in an `output` schema. It also rejects open-ended keys, such as
`z.record()` or `.passthrough()`, and `.nullable()` does not help there. For
those, pass `providerOptions: {openai: {strictJsonSchema: false}}`. Tool input
and output are validated against their Zod schemas either way.

`modelGateway(call)` sends model requests to another Restate handler. Use it
to centralize keys, quotas, or routing in one service:

```ts
import {modelGateway} from "@restatedev/agentlib/provider";

const viaGateway = modelGateway((request) => restate.client(gateway).generate(request));
```

A model is just a generator from `ModelRequest` to `ModelResponse`, so
`journaledModel(async (request, {signal}) => ...)` wraps any other client.

## Testing without paid model calls

Give the agents a fixture model and run the services in a real Restate
container with forced replay:

```ts
import {journaledModel, type ModelResponse} from "@restatedev/agentlib";

const fixtureModel = journaledModel(async (request): Promise<ModelResponse> => {
  if (request.tools.length > 0 && request.step === 1)
    return {
      type: "tool_calls",
      calls: [{id: "t1", name: "lookupTicket", input: {ticketId: "T-42"}}],
    };
  if (request.outputSchema)
    return {type: "final", text: "", output: {category: "billing", summary: "…"}};
  return {type: "final", text: "Ticket T-42 is open."};
});
```

- Build agents from a model you can swap: pass it in, read it from a shared
  module, or mock that module in tests.
- Start `RestateTestEnvironment` with
  `container: () => new RestateContainer().alwaysReplay().disableRetries()` (see
  `restate-gen-sdk`'s `running-and-testing.md`), then call the services
  through `@restatedev/restate-sdk-clients`.
- Assert on observable effects: tools that must run once really run once,
  approvals block until resolved, and a race loser is cleaned up.

The repository's
[examples.integration.ts](https://github.com/restatedev/agentlib/blob/main/packages/tests/src/examples.integration.ts)
tests the lessons this way.
