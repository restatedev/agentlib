  Build durable AI agents with the Restate agent SDK (@restatedev/agentlib):
  an agent runs inside a Restate generator handler, and every model call, tool
  result, approval, and sub-agent step is journaled, so work survives crashes,
  deploys, and long waits. Use when the user wants to build, extend, or debug
  an AI agent on Restate; mentions @restatedev/agentlib, agent(), asyncTool,
  handoff, agentTool, serviceTool, mcpTools, needsApproval, steering, or
  interrupting an agent; or wants multi-agent workflows (routing, racing,
  orchestrator-workers, evaluator-optimizer, peer review) composed from Restate
  services. Also use when teaching someone the SDK step by step.

# Restate agents

An agent is a value you define once and `run` from any Restate handler. The
handler owns everything around the run: where history is stored, who
approves, what happens after. The agent owns the model/tool loop. Because the
run happens inside a Restate invocation, completed model calls and tool
results replay from the journal instead of repeating.

```ts
import * as restate from "@restatedev/restate-sdk-gen";
import {agent} from "@restatedev/agentlib";
import {openAIModel} from "@restatedev/agentlib/openai";

const assistant = agent({model: openAIModel({model: "gpt-5.6-luna"})});

export const hello = restate.service({
  name: "Hello",
  handlers: {
    *ask(question: string) {
      const result = yield* assistant.run(question);
      return result.status === "completed" ? result.output : result.reason;
    },
  },
});
```

Agents build on the generator SDK. Load the `restate-gen-sdk` skill as well:
its rules (generators, `yield*`, no `Promise.all`, journal every side effect)
apply to agent handlers and tools too.

## Setup

- Dependencies: `@restatedev/agentlib`, `@restatedev/restate-sdk`,
  `@restatedev/restate-sdk-gen`, and `zod`. The agent SDK lives in
  https://github.com/restatedev/agentlib.
- A model adapter. OpenAI models (and OpenAI-compatible servers) use
  `openAIModel` from `@restatedev/agentlib/openai`. Every other model
  (Anthropic, Bedrock, Google, Mistral, OpenRouter, ...) goes through the
  [Vercel AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev): install that provider's `@ai-sdk/*`
  package and wrap its model with `aiModel` from `@restatedev/agentlib/provider`.
  See `references/models-and-testing.md`.
- Serve the handlers with `serve({services, port: 9080})` from
  `@restatedev/restate-sdk` and register them, as in the `restate-gen-sdk`
  skill.

## Learning path

The numbered lessons in the repository introduce one concept at a time:
https://github.com/restatedev/agentlib/tree/main/packages/examples/src/lessons.
Follow the same order when teaching or when growing an agent step by step.

**When teaching:** go one row at a time. Show the smallest code that adds
the new concept to the previous step, run it with curl, and explain what
Restate journals. Move on only when the learner is ready.

## Find the right tool for a goal

## Rules to check before finishing

- [ ] Define agents at module scope. Run them inside handlers or tools with
      `yield* agent.run(...)`.
- [ ] Handle every `RunResult` status: `completed`, `stopped` (hit
      `maxSteps` or `maxToolCalls`), and `interrupted`. Do not read `output` as the answer
      unless the status is `completed`.
- [ ] Give each run a distinct `name` when one handler runs the same agent
      more than once (loops, races), so journal entries and approval signals
      stay apart.
- [ ] Tool side effects run in `asyncTool.execute` or `restate.run`. Code in a
      `tool` generator outside those is replayed.
- [ ] Give external writes an idempotency key (`context.callId` is stable
      across retries).
- [ ] Throw `ToolError` for failures the model should see and recover from,
      and `TerminalError` to stop retrying. A tool that fails terminally
      reports an error to the model; the run continues.
- [ ] Trusted values (prices, user IDs, limits) come from run `context`,
      never from model-supplied tool arguments.
- [ ] Approval requests and active-turn IDs stored in state are cleared in a
      `finally`.
- [ ] Tests use a fixture model (`journaledModel`) against
      `RestateContainer().alwaysReplay().disableRetries()`. No paid model calls.
